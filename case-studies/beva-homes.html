                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Beva Homes, a residential real estate investor, was hitting a growth ceiling because leads,
                        calls, and follow-ups were scattered across tools and inboxes. A unified GoHighLevel CRM
                        implementation turned their seller pipeline into a structured, always-on system with instant
                        responses, fast human calls, disciplined nurture, and clear KPIs—allowing the same small team to
                        handle several times more leads without sacrificing speed or quality.</p>
                    <p>Before this project, Beva Homes did not have a proper, integrated CRM and relied on tools like
                        Invelo without email, SMS, and telephony living in one system. Leads arrived via PPC, Facebook
                        Lead Ads, lists, referrals, and phone calls, but because everything was fragmented, new
                        opportunities were easy to miss or forget. Response times were slow, since nobody had a single
                        “inbox” for all fresh leads, and follow‑up depended on manual effort and memory, so warm sellers
                        often went cold before decisions were made.</p>
                    <p>The owner also had no clean way to see speed‑to‑lead, stage aging, or conversion by stage/source,
                        even though in real estate investing a single motivated seller can be worth six figures and one
                        strong off‑market relationship can compound into many deals over time—meaning every missed or
                        mishandled lead could represent hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost opportunity.</p>

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>AIT Automation Solutions built a GoHighLevel-based CRM that acts as Beva Homes’ central nervous
                        system for leads and a speed‑and‑consistency engine for follow-up. All seller leads now flow
                        into structured Seller Acquisition, Disposition, and Nurture pipelines with clearly defined
                        stages, SLAs, and stage‑based checklists.</p>

                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>Every lead source—PPC forms, Facebook Lead Ads, Invelo imports, email parser feeds, and tracked
                        phone numbers—is integrated so all new enquiries land in one place with standardised fields,
                        tags, and routing logic. Inbound call routing with Voice AI, bilingual EN/ES SMS templates, and
                        quiet‑hour/compliance guardrails are embedded directly into the CRM configuration, so the system
                        can respond instantly, route correctly, and stay compliant without extra manual work.</p>
                    <p>When a new seller comes in through any channel, GoHighLevel creates or updates the contact and
                        opportunity, tags the source, and drops the lead into the Seller Acquisition pipeline. An
                        automation immediately sends a confirmation SMS/email and triggers a “speed‑to‑lead” call
                        workflow so a human attempts a call within minutes during business hours.</p>
                    <p>As conversations progress, the opportunity moves through stages like Contact Attempted, Contact
                        Made, Offer Prep, Offer Sent, Under Negotiation, and Contract Signed, with checklists and tasks
                        created automatically at each step. Leads that are not ready to sell now are pushed into Hot,
                        Warm, Cold, or Future nurture tracks with scheduled SMS, email, and call prompts over weeks and
                        months, and “dead” leads are later reactivated so the database is continually worked instead of
                        going stale.</p>

                    that Beva Homes leaves potentially million‑dollar opportunities on the table simply because nobody
                    saw or followed up on a lead in time.</p>

                        leads than before without adding headcount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> The owner and team can see every lead and deal by stage, how long
                        opportunities sit in each step, and key KPIs from a single dashboard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Automated reactivation ensures historical data is actively worked
                        instead of sitting idle in spreadsheets.</li>
